                    <hr>
                    <p class="text">In modern life, we are surrounded by technology. It's integral to everything we do, big or small. We can find examples of technology in our homes and personal spaces, in industry, in business, and in the medical profession. Most people know technology when they see it, but what exactly is technology?</p>
                    <p class="text">Technology is the way we apply scientific knowledge for practical purposes. It includes machines, like computers, but also techniques and the way we produce computer chips. It might seem like all technology is only electronic, but that's just most modern technology. Human's first technology was a hammer and the wheel.</p>
                    <p class="text">Let's consider some examples of how technology is integral to our daily lives. When you get up in the morning, you probably get out of a bed. The synthetic materials of the mattress upon which you were sleeping, and springs underneath, are both examples of technology.</p>
                    <p class="text">If it's still early, you might turn on the light first. Both the light bulbs and the electrical systems that power them are also technology. Later, when you brush your teeth, the system that brings you water to the sink, the bathroom fan, the toothbrush - and the toilet, for that matter - are technology.  </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="text">The history of computers goes back over 200 years. At first theorized by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, during the 19th century mechanical calculating machines were designed and built to solve the increasingly complex number-crunching challenges. The advancement of technology enabled ever more-complex computers by the early 20th century, and computers became larger and more powerful.</p>
                    <p class="text">Today, computers are almost unrecognizable from designs of the 19th century, such as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine — or even from the huge computers of the 20th century that occupied whole rooms, such as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator.  </p>

                        <p class="text">Technology has a more positive impact on humans or society as compared to negative. It makes our life easier and reward us by providing resources or tool that make our life much easier.</p>
                        <p class="text">Communication is the most important part of society, we build or transfer our thoughts with each other with the help of communication. Earlier people used pigeons or birds to transfer their messages to their loved ones. After that technology slowly grows and the medium of transferring information is changed to mobile phones, email, etc. Nowadays we send messages to loved ones or known people via email, social media platforms, etc. It is the fastest, efficient, and effective medium. People can talk or share information with their loved ones easily even if they are very far away from them.</p>
                        <p class="text">Technology enhances the education and learning process. Nowadays people can easily enhance their knowledge using the internet. Most of the data is present on the internet is free of cost and you can access this data anytime and anywhere.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="text">Without Alan Turing developing his machine that is known as the first computer, we would never have the ability to share inforamtion at the rate we do today. The best way to learn would be from someone who already knows the topics or books. Even with books, the rate at which we move and innovate today is uncompareable to any other time in history when human had existed.Within 33 years of the turing machine being developed, they landind on the moon. A simple 40,000 lines of code that moved humans forward. Today, 50 years since they landed on teh moon, people like me who dont specialize in programming as a career are able to create at a faster rate than them. Especial since the internet has used by the public for a total of 29 years. Many people think the future is going to be about human with a better technology than we currently do. </p>
