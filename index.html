                    <hr>
                    <p class="text">In modern life, we are surrounded by technology. It's integral to everything we do, big or small. We can find examples of technology in our homes and personal spaces, in industry, in business, and in the medical profession. Most people know technology when they see it, but what exactly is technology?</p>
                    <p class="text">Technology is the way we apply scientific knowledge for practical purposes. It includes machines, like computers, but also techniques and the way we produce computer chips. It might seem like all technology is only electronic, but that's just most modern technology. Human's first technology was a hammer and the wheel.</p>
                    <p class="text">Let's consider some examples of how technology is integral to our daily lives. When you get up in the morning, you probably get out of a bed. The synthetic materials of the mattress upon which you were sleeping, and springs underneath, are both examples of technology.</p>
                    <p class="text">If it's still early, you might turn on the light first. Both the light bulbs and the electrical systems that power them are also technology. Later, when you brush your teeth, the system that brings you water to the sink, the bathroom fan, the toothbrush - and the toilet, for that matter - are technology.  </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="text">The history of computers goes back over 200 years. At first theorized by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, during the 19th century mechanical calculating machines were designed and built to solve the increasingly complex number-crunching challenges. The advancement of technology enabled ever more-complex computers by the early 20th century, and computers became larger and more powerful.</p>
                    <p class="text">Today, computers are almost unrecognizable from designs of the 19th century, such as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine — or even from the huge computers of the 20th century that occupied whole rooms, such as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator.  </p>

                        <p class="text">Technology has a more positive impact on humans or society as compared to negative. It makes our life easier and reward us by providing resources or tool that make our life much easier.</p>
                        <p class="text">Communication is the most important part of society, we build or transfer our thoughts with each other with the help of communication. Earlier people used pigeons or birds to transfer their messages to their loved ones. After that technology slowly grows and the medium of transferring information is changed to mobile phones, email, etc. Nowadays we send messages to loved ones or known people via email, social media platforms, etc. It is the fastest, efficient, and effective medium. People can talk or share information with their loved ones easily even if they are very far away from them.</p>
                        <p class="text">Technology enhances the education and learning process. Nowadays people can easily enhance their knowledge using the internet. Most of the data is present on the internet is free of cost and you can access this data anytime and anywhere.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="text">Without Alan Turing developing his machine known as the first computer, we would never have the ability to share information at the rate we do today. The best way to learn would be from someone who already knows the topics or books. Even with books, the rate at which we move and innovate today is incomparable to any other time in history when humans had existed. 33 years after Turing's machine development, humans landed on the moon. A simple 40,000 lines of code that moved humans forward. Today, 50 years since they landed on the moon, people like me who don't specialize in programming as a career can create faster than before. Since the internet's creation, the public has used the internet for 29 years. After 29 years, humans have found the internet very interesting. We as a species journey to websites like youtube and watch for hours. Not to mention that 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. That's nothing compared to the 250 million hours of content watched per day.</p>
                    <p class="text">Many people think the future is going to be about humans with unknown super technology. Something that is life-altering like a robot to help us without daily lives. Movies portray cars that drive themselves and machines that travel the universe. Both the good of these techniques are presented and the possibilities of the negative side too, like the terminator or I, robot.</p>
