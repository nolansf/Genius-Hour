The full understanding of technology in neccessary while the usage of programming never hurt anyone while getting a job. Many jobs that once utilized many hands in order to complete, like the assemby belt to make cars, are fully automated by machines.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Invented by Alan Turing in 1936, the turing machine is the first step in the line of our modern eletrical computers. A Turing machine consists of a line of cells known as the "tape", together with a single active cell, known as the "head". The cells on the tape can have a certain set of possible colors, and the head can be in a certain set of possible states. Any particular Turing machine is defined by a rule which specifies what the head should do at each step. The rule looks at the state of the head, and the color of the cell that the head is on. Then it specifies what the new state of the head should be. </p>

                impact
            without alan turing developing his machine that the first computer, we would never have teh ability to share inforamtion at the rate we do today. The best way to learn would be from someone who already knows the topics or books. Even with books, the rate at which we move and innovate today is uncompareable to any other time in history when human had existed. 
            .   Within 33 years of the turing machine being developed, they landind on the moon. A simple 40,000 lines of code that moved humans forward. Today, 50 years since they landed on teh moon, people like me who dont specialize in programming as a career are able to create at a faster rate than them. Especial since the internet has used by the public for a total of 29 years.
                future
            Many people thikn the future is going to be about human with a better technology than we currently do.
