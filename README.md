# The Project

Initally, this project was used for me to see how much i have retained and left to learn in the space of ui/ux design.

This project was very difficult for me. I haev to learn new way and mediums to be able to produce a look that would be good enough to present to class. Even though the project is submitted, this doesnt mean that the project itself will ever be comeplete. I intend to continue toupdate the website as frequently as i can when i learn something new while exploring the internet.

At the start, i though i was goin gto build a simple website that uses an api, but i didn't tihnk that was going to be enough will be trying new thinng, testing pallets and building a site not as a portfolio but to test all new skills
