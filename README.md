# The Project

Initally, this project was used for me to see how much i have retained and left to learn in the space of ui/ux design.

This project was very difficult for me. I haev to learn new way and mediums to be able to produce a look that would be good enough to present to class. Even though the project is submitted, this doesnt mean that the project itself will ever be comeplete. I intend to continue toupdate the website as frequently as i can when i learn something new while exploring the internet.

At the start, i though i was goin gto build a simple website that uses an api, but i didn't tihnk that was going to be enough will be trying new thinng, testing pallets and building a site not as a portfolio but to test all new skills

Discuss with the class why you have chosen this particular project
Why is this your passion or interest and how did it start? Include in your conversation with us which of the four areas of our exploration you chose (Help Make the World/Community a Better Place; The UnGoogleable; Create/Innovate; Learn or Master).
What was your perception of yourself before beginning this project? Has that perception changed and why do you think that is?
Has this encouraged creativity in you? If so, how?
Do you feel as if this is something you will continue to do and why?
During the beginning of this course, we discussed whether we believed that schools kill creativity as we applied our own definition - considering this, what type of advice would you give to a young child as they move their way through elementary, middle, and high school.
From what you’ve learned about yourself and what you’ve learned from this project, what is one major lesson that you would impart to your classmates before graduating?
